# AS Ideas Recruitment

 Recruitment task done by me for a junior oriented position @Ideas Engineering. 
 
 ## Comments on the workflow
 
 | Task | Description | Comment |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| 1 | Showing a static HTML page | No Problems, as expected :)
| 2 | Add a Menu & Single-Page-Site | SPA were new for me, research granted valuable architecture insides
| 3 | Loading Data from a REST-Service | fetch refresher, realized that I used too much tutorial boilerplate before, so this was a nice training session
| 4 | JavaScript Tool Chain | Preprocessing using SASS, new technology but I appreciate the possibilities a lot! + Minified a CSS file as test
| 5 | Create Unit-Tests for your JS | Tinkering around with jest, learning the concept but focused on frontend / design due to time limitation. Probably the wrong approach during production. :) 
| 6 | CRUD for universes | Started a for element for the universe call, could not debug a matching response in time (400 error code)
| 7 | Pagination | Looked at the concept, applied browser history.pushState. Probably not what the question asked tho! :D


## Encountered Problems

  * SPA Architecture vs. Current Knowledge
    * Best Practices + Project Structure
    * fetch() updates page Elements -> how to persist data?
    * Menu bar styling only allows certain element to force SPA behavior, icons e.g. cause a reload
* CRUD POST had bad format, tried <form> but could not send proper request
* Pagination 

## What went well

* fetch() applied, helped to understand the concept
* SPA partially works on Imprint/Home! (will need to dive deeper privately, its blazing fast)
* Design + Basic wireframing
    * Altough I need to dive deeper into the backend communication part, I really enjoyed trying out that fancy navbar
    * SASS + Minifying, I'll keep that in mind (especially in big projects)

### Useful ressources

I like to share stuff, so this might come in handy later on

* [SPA] - learned a lot from this post 
* [FullStack Roadmap] - always shows me where I am and what lies ahead of me
* [Design] - if your not inspired after this post, I don't know how to get you 
* [Jest Docu] - although this was quite a lot at the beginning, they actually provide well documented examples!
* [MDN fetch()] - MDN proves its worth once again

## That wraps it up!
### Thanks again for this oppurtunity @AS Ideas :v:
